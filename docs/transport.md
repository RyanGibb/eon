### Transport

The [transport.ml](src/transport.ml) file contains logic to use DNS as a stream or datagram [transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_layer) protocol.
An example application that uses this can be found in [netcat.ml](bin/transport/netcat.ml)/[netcatd.ml](bin/transport/netcatd.ml).

This is a work in progress and seems to have some bugs to iron out.
